This rock-paper-scissors game has a weak commitment scheme.
There are only 3 values we can commit to and no salt or nonce is added, the commitment is a simple keccak256 with the raw value.
We can precompute the values for ROCK, PAPER and SCISSORS and wait for our opponent to commit to one these values.
Then we query the contract to see his commitment and compare it with the precomputed values, then we choose our action.
